## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow




### What I learned

First of all in just 8 hours I learned and improved my coding skils so much and now i am feeling more confident and motivated to learn everyday more and more new things.

```html
<div class="cool">Some HTML code I'm proud of</div>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display:flex;
}
```

### Continued development

Now i want to focus on Html Css and Js and want to know almost everything about this languages and  then i am planning to learn framewrok like react or angular and also back-end development. 

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me to learn syntax. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand Html css flex-box. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
